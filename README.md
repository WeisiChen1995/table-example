I explored the R gtsummary package to generate high-quality descriptive tables suitable for academic publications. Additionally, I customized the default settings to refine the table's appearance. The tables are available for view download in HTML, PDF, and MS Word formats. You can access them by clicking on the "Other formats" option on the left-hand side of the webpage.
